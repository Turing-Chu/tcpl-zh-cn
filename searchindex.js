It's a small object that has an associated stack of 8MB, which is what is usually assigned to an operating system thread. Fibers, unlike threads, are cooperative. Threads are pre-emptive: the operating system might interrupt a thread at any time and start executing another one. A fiber must explicitly tell the Runtime Scheduler to switch to another fiber. For example if there's I/O to be waited on, a fiber will tell the scheduler \"Look, I have to wait for this I/O to be available, you continue executing other fibers and come back to me when that I/O is ready\". The advantage of being cooperative is that a lot of the overhead of doing a context switch (switching between threads) is gone. A Fiber is much more lightweight than a thread: even though it's assigned 8MB, it starts with a small stack of 4KB. On a 64-bit machine it lets us spawn millions and millions of fibers. In a 32-bit machine we can only spawn 512 fibers, which is not a lot.

The problem is that there's only one variable i that all spawned fibers refer to, and when Fiber.yield is executed its value is 10. To solve this, we can do this: i = 0\nwhile i < 10 proc = ->(x : Int32) do spawn do puts(x) end end proc.call(i) i += 1\nend Fiber.yield Now it works because we are creating a Proc and we invoke it passing i , so the value gets copied and now the spawned fiber receives a copy. To avoid all this boilerplate, the standard library provides a spawn macro that accepts a call expression and basically rewrites it to do the above. Using it, we end up with: i = 0\nwhile i < 10 spawn puts(i) i += 1\nend Fiber.yield This is mostly useful with local variables that change at iterations. This doesn't happen with block arguments. For example, this works as expected: 10.times do |i| spawn do puts i end\nend Fiber.yield","breadcrumbs":"指引 » Spawning a call","id":"guides/concurrency.html#spawning-a-call","title":"Spawning a call"},"guides/concurrency.html#spawning-a-fiber":{"body":"To spawn a fiber you use spawn with a block: spawn do # ... socket.gets # ...\nend spawn do # ... sleep 5.seconds # ...\nend Here we have two fibers: one reads from a socket and the other does a sleep . When the first fiber reaches the socket.gets line, it gets suspended, the Event Loop is told to continue executing this fiber when there's data in the socket, and the program continues with the second fiber. This fiber wants to sleep for 5 seconds, so the Event Loop is told to continue with this fiber in 5 seconds. If there aren't other fibers to execute, the Event Loop will wait until either of these events happen, without consuming CPU time. The reason why socket.gets and sleep behave like this is because their implementations talk directly with the Runtime Scheduler and the Event Loop, there's nothing magical about it. In general, the standard library already takes care of doing all of this so you don't have to. Note, however, that fibers don't get executed right away. For example: spawn do loop do puts \"Hello!\" end\nend Running the above code will produce no output and exit immediately. The reason for this is that a fiber is not executed as soon as it is spawned. So, the main fiber, the one that spawns the above fiber, finishes its execution and the program exits. One way to solve it is to do a sleep : spawn do loop do puts \"Hello!\" end\nend sleep 1.second This program will now print \"Hello!\" for one second and then exit. This is because the sleep call will schedule the main fiber to be executed in a second, and then executes another \"ready to execute\" fiber, which in this case is the one above. Another way is this: spawn do loop do puts \"Hello!\" end\nend Fiber.yield This time Fiber.yield will tell the scheduler to execute the other fiber. This will print \"Hello!\" until the standard output blocks (the system call will tell us we have to wait until the output is ready), and then execution continues with the main fiber and the program exits. Here the standard output might never block so the program will continue executing forever. If we want to execute the spawned fiber for ever, we can use sleep without arguments: spawn do loop do puts \"Hello!\" end\nend sleep Of course the above program can be written without spawn at all, just with a loop. sleep is more useful when spawning more than one fiber.","breadcrumbs":"指引 » Spawning a fiber","id":"guides/concurrency.html#spawning-a-fiber","title":"Spawning a fiber"},"guides/concurrency.html#spawning-a-fiber-and-waiting-for-it-to-complete":{"body":"We can use a channel for this: channel = Channel(Nil).new spawn do puts \"Before send\" channel.send(nil) puts \"After send\"\nend puts \"Before receive\"\nchannel.receive\nputs \"After receive\" This prints: Before receive\nBefore send\nAfter receive First, the program spawns a fiber but doesn't execute it yet. When we invoke channel.receive , the main fiber blocks and execution continues with the spawned fiber. Then channel.send(nil) is invoked, and so execution continues at channel.receive , which was waiting for a value. Then the main fiber continues executing and finishes, so the program exits without giving the other fiber a chance to print \"After send\". In the above example we used nil just to communicate that the fiber ended. We can also use channels to communicate values between fibers: channel = Channel(Int32).new spawn do puts \"Before first send\" channel.send(1) puts \"Before second send\" channel.send(2)\nend puts \"Before first receive\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 1 puts \"Before second receive\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 2 Output: Before first receive\nBefore first send\n1\nBefore second receive\nBefore second send\n2 Note that when the program executes a receive , that fiber blocks and execution continues with the other fiber. When send is executed, execution continues with the fiber that was waiting on that channel. Here we are sending literal values, but the spawned fiber might compute this value by, for example, reading a file, or getting it from a socket. When this fiber will have to wait for I/O, other fibers will be able to continue executing code until I/O is ready, and finally when the value is ready and sent through the channel, the main fiber will receive it. For example: require \"socket\" channel = Channel(String).new spawn do server = TCPServer.new(\"0.0.0.0\", 8080) socket = server.accept while line = socket.gets channel.send(line) end\nend spawn do while line = gets channel.send(line) end\nend 3.times do puts channel.receive\nend The above program spawns two fibers. The first one creates a TCPServer, accepts one connection and reads lines from it, sending them to the channel. There's a second fiber reading lines from standard input. The main fiber reads the first 3 messages sent to the channel, either from the socket or stdin, then the program exits. The gets calls will block the fibers and tell the Event Loop to continue from there if data comes. Likewise, we can wait for multiple fibers to complete execution, and gather their values: channel = Channel(Int32).new 10.times do |i| spawn do channel.send(i * 2) end\nend sum = 0\n10.times do sum += channel.receive\nend\nputs sum # => 90 You can, of course, use receive inside a spawned fiber: channel = Channel(Int32).new spawn do puts \"Before send\" channel.send(1) puts \"After send\"\nend spawn do puts \"Before receive\" puts channel.receive puts \"After receive\"\nend puts \"Before yield\"\nFiber.yield\nputs \"After yield\" Output: Before yield\nBefore send\nBefore receive\n1\nAfter receive\nAfter send\nAfter yield Here channel.send is executed first, but since there's no one waiting for a value (yet), execution continues in other fibers. The second fiber is executed, there's a value on the channel, it's obtained, and execution continues, first with the first fiber, then with the main fiber, because Fiber.yield puts a fiber at the end of the execution queue.","breadcrumbs":"指引 » Spawning a fiber and waiting for it to complete","id":"guides/concurrency.html#spawning-a-fiber-and-waiting-for-it-to-complete","title":"Spawning a fiber and waiting for it to complete"},"guides/concurrency.html#the-runtime-scheduler":{"body":"The scheduler has a queue of: Fibers ready to be executed: for example when you spawn a fiber, it's ready to be executed.

Many projects use a custom spec helper which organizes these includes. Concrete test cases are defined in it blocks. An optional (but strongly recommended) descriptive string states it's purpose and a block contains the main logic performing the test. Test cases that have been defined or outlined but are not yet expected to work can be defined using pending instead of it . They will not be run but show up in the spec report as pending. An it block contains an example that should invoke the code to be tested and define what is expected of it. Each example can contain multiple expectations, but it should test only one specific behaviour. When spec is included, every object has the instance methods #should and #should_not . These methods are invoked on the value being tested with an expectation as argument. If the expectation is met, code execution continues. Otherwise the example has failed and other code in this block will not be executed. In test files, specs are structured by example groups which are defined by describe and context sections. Typically a top level describe defines the outer unit (such as a class) to be tested by the spec. Further describe sections can be nested within the outer unit to specify smaller units under test (such as individual methods). For unit tests, it is recommended to follow the conventions for method names: Outer describe is the name of the class, inner describe targets methods. Instance methods are prefixed with # , class methods with . . To establish certain contexts - think empty array versus array with elements - the context method may be used to communicate this to the reader. It has a different name, but behaves exactly like describe . describe and context take a description as argument (which should usually be a string) and a block containing the individual specs or nested groupings.","breadcrumbs":"指引 » Anatomy of a spec file","id":"guides/testing.html#anatomy-of-a-spec-file","title":"Anatomy of a spec file"},"guides/testing.html#a测试-crystal-代码":{"body":"Crystal comes with a fully-featured spec library in the Spec module .

The standard library usually doesn't have a namespace as its types and methods are very common, to avoid writing long names. To use a module as a partial type you use include or extend .

We will store this information in instance variables, which are always prefixed with an at ( @ ) character. We also want a Person to come into existence with a name of our choice and an age of zero.

This is a class method that belongs to the class Person , not to particular instances of that class. This is why we can do Person.new .

A class implicitly inherits from Reference . A struct cannot inherit a non-abstract struct. The last point has a reason to it: a struct has a very well defined memory layout.

If you have an array of points the points are embedded inside the array's buffer: # The array's buffer will have 8 bytes dedicated to each Point\nary = [] of Point If Point is inherited, an array of such type must also account for the fact that other types can be inside it, so the size of each element must grow to accommodate that. That is certainly unexpected. So, non-abstract structs can't be inherited. Abstract structs, on the other hand, will have descendants, so it's expected that an array of them will account for the possibility of having multiple types inside it. A struct can also include modules and can be generic, just like a class. A struct is mostly used for performance reasons to avoid lots of small memory allocations when passing small copies might be more efficient. So how do you choose between a struct and a class?

The + means it's a virtual type, meaning \"any class that inherits from Animal , including Animal \". The compiler will always resolve a type union to a virtual type if they are under the same hierarchy: if some_condition pet = Dog.new\nelse pet = Cat.new\nend # pet : Animal+ The compiler will always do this for classes and structs under the same hierarchy: it will find the first superclass from which all types inherit from (excluding Reference , Value , Int and Float ). If it can't find one, the type union remains. The real reason the compiler does this is to be able to compile programs faster by not creating all kinds of different similar unions, also making the generated code smaller in size. But, on the other hand, it makes sense: classes under the same hierarchy should behave in a similar way. Lets make John's pet talk: john.pet.talk # Error: undefined method 'talk' for Animal We get an error because the compiler now treats @pet as an Animal+ , which includes Animal . And since it can't find a talk method on it, it errors. What the compiler doesn't know is that for us, Animal will never be instantiated as it doesn't make sense to instantiate one.
